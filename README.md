# Snake_Game
The classic snake game that everyone played in their Nokia devices.
The game is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For nostalgic purposes, I have let the snake pass through walls. It also makes up for longer gameplays.
To increase difficulty, the game speeds up a little every time the snake eats their food. To increase or decrease the increment rate, make changes to the game_speed variable.
